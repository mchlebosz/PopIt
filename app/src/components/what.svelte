			A Popit toy is a silicone fidget toy that is designed to provide a fun and satisfying way to
			fidget and relieve stress. It is typically small and portable, making it easy to carry and use
			on the go. Popit toys are made of soft, flexible silicone, which makes them comfortable to
			hold and manipulate. They are often designed with a variety of textures and features, such as
			bumps, ridges, and nubs, which provide a satisfying tactile sensation when played with. Some
			Popit toys may also have features such as clips or loops that allow them to be attached to
			clothing or other objects. Popit toys are popular with people of all ages and are often used
			as a tool to help with focus, concentration, and stress management.
